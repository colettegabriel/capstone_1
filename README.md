Potential analytics questions:
When items are discounted to boost sales, what is the average amount of that discount?
Is there a correlation between the 'Usage' and 'Season' classifications? For example, if a style is listed as sporty 
('Usage' = Sports), is it more likely to be a summer item? This information could help in creating a product classifier.
Difference in average pricing for men vs. women for the different seasons?
